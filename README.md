# sirix-rust-client

Interact with [SirixDB](https://sirix.io) from Rust.

## This is alpha software

It does not yet do the thing.  Once it does, I can't guarantee it will do so correctly.

## Crates

* [bytes](https://github.com/tokio-rs/bytes) - Working with streams of bytes
* [hyper](https://hyper.rs) - HTTP
* [serde](https://serde.rs/) - Serialization/deserialization
* [thiserror](https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror) - Macros for error-type definitions
* [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) - Asynchronous runtime

### Development-Only

* [pretty_assertions](https://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-pretty-assertions) - Colorful test output
